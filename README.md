# Pick Me Up

WORK IN PROGRESS...

Everybody needs some help sometimes. Encouraging words can do miracles, especially when
they come from someone you know, trust, and love. That's what Pick Me up is all about.

# TODO

* experiment with play
* experiment with continuous play
* show clip info
* pick color scheme, fonts and styles

# Notes

Convert `.m4a` to `.aac`:

```bash
ffmpeg -i clip-1.m4a -codec:a aac clip-1.aac
```
